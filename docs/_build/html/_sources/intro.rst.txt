Introduction
============

``xnat_wrapper`` is a wrapper that streamlines the functionality of ``pyxnat`` and allows the user to easily create, edit, and run analysis functions on XNAT projects, sessions, and scans. 

Usage
=====

The ``xnat_wrapper`` utility consists of three classes:
* Connector

    * UIDImporter (``Connector.importer``)
    * CommandUtility (``Connector.commands``)

To start an XNAT connection, initialize the connector class using either of these options (optionally including a project name):
By supplying the server, username, and password:

.. code-block:: python

    xnat = Connector(server='your.xnat.instance.ip.address',user='username',password='password',project='project_name')

or by supplying a configuration file containing all 3 (in JSON format):

.. code-block:: python

    xnat = Connector(config='xnat_login.cfg', project='project_name')

Access the importer utility to set a list of UIDs, find them, and import them into your project:

.. code-block:: python

    xnat.importer.set_uids(uid_list)
    xnat.importer.find_studies()
    import_success = xnat.importer.import_studies()

After successfully importing your studies, you can monitor the import queue using:

.. code-block:: python

    xnat.importer.monitor_import_queue()

Once that process is complete, you will need to close the XNAT session before exiting the program using:

.. code-block:: python

    xnat.close_session()
